Revision history for Text-sprintfn

0.05    2012-10-03 (SHARYANTO)

        No functional changes. Faster performance by avoid using named capture
        in regex. Benchmark on a simple format: sprintfn("%(a)s%s%s", {a=>1,
        b=>9}, 2, 3), shows increase from around 19k/s to 49k/sec (about 150%
        speed increase).


0.04    2011-11-01 (SHARYANTO)

        No functional changes. Add missing $VERSION.


0.03    2011-10-23 (SHARYANTO)

        Rewrite implementation (third time's the charm), now everything works
        and only calls sprintf() once.


0.02    2011-10-23 (SHARYANTO)

        Rewrite implementation, now works with * and \d+$, but still has trouble
        with vector flag combination.


0.01    2011-10-22 (SHARYANTO)

        First release, still has problems with '*' in formats.
